*A word frequency analyzer. Learning a new language the Zipf way.*

This is a simple utility to analyze the frequency of words in a text. The
idea is to use that data in a new language learning, leveraging the Zipf law.
That is, learning the most frequent words before, it will allow to reach the
point of being able to read books as soon as possible, and then switch to 
a more entertaining book-reding based learning.
